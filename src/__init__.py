"""
Congruity Cone — core package.

This package contains the minimal, interpretable primitives for:
- curvature (1st/2nd order) on a signal (e.g., I/V),
- drift accumulation and plateau detection,
- endogenous thresholds from admissible history,
- regime shift detection and re-baselining hooks.

Toy repo: keep it simple, readable, no black boxes.
