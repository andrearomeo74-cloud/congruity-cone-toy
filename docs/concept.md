# Congruity Cones — Conceptual Framework

## Prediction vs Admissibility

Congruity Cones are not a prediction system.

They do not forecast specific events, outcomes, or timelines.
They do not estimate probabilities of occurrence.
They do not attempt to be right about the future.

Instead, Congruity Cones operate on a different question:

Not:
“what will happen?”

But:
“what is still structurally allowed to happen from here?”

This is a shift from probabilistic prediction to admissibility filtering.

## Why error bars are the wrong question

Asking for prediction error, accuracy percentage, or confidence intervals
assumes a predictive model of the future.

Congruity Cones do not produce predictions, therefore they do not have
a prediction error in the classical sense.

Their output is not a forecast, but a constraint:
a reduction of the future state space.

The correct question is not:
“How accurate is this prediction?”

But:
“How much of the future space is structurally excluded ex-ante?”

## What Congruity Cones actually restrict

Classic Congruity evaluates a state at time t.

Congruity Cones evaluate the *trajectory* emerging from that state.

They restrict:
- Excessive curvature (non-linear escalation)
- Accumulated drift on plateaus
- Volatility incompatible with historical tolerance
- Desynchronization between interacting agents
- Regime transitions without sufficient structural support

The result is a cone-shaped admissible future region,
derived from history, not from scenario simulation.

Outside the cone, trajectories are not unlikely.
They are structurally unsustainable.

## Why this generalizes across domains

Congruity Cones do not encode domain knowledge.

They do not know what the system represents:
- a market
- a biological process
- an infrastructure network
- an institutional or social system

They operate on invariant structural properties:
distance, drift, curvature, volatility, and synchrony.

Because structural limits precede domain semantics,
the same admissibility logic applies across domains
without retraining, optimization, or reward shaping.

This is why Congruity Cones are domain-agnostic,
but not domain-blind.

They exclude futures that cannot hold,
before asking what those futures mean.
